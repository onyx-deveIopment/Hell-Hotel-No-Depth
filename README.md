# About

This is a project started for [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)'s [Campfire game jam](https://flagship.hackclub.com/).

Inspired by another game we at the [ONYX Development](https://onyx.andrewcromar.org/) team have been working on for quite some time called Hell Hotel. While the scope for that game is large, this 2d version can have a much smaller and simpler scope allowing us to finish within the 2 months of the game jam.

Right now we are focusing on making the game. We indend to release a few devlogs after the game jam and release the game to steam. We want to include acheivements and lots of other fun stuff. But, that is starting to make the scope too big. So for now we will just be making the working game as simple as possible. After an initial/early acess release we will do a few update to add more cool features (and chapters if we have the energy).
